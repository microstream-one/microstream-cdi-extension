# Microstream CDI extension

The Microstream CDI extension is an open-source project to integrate the Jakarta EE/MicroProfile world with the Microstream persistence solution.

This project has two minimum requirements:

* A CDI 2.0 implementation or higher
* An Eclipse MicroProfile Config 2.0 implementation or higher

MicroStream Data-Store is a native Java object graph storage engine. From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only:


**To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user.**
